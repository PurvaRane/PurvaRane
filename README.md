<h3 align="center">Computer Engineering Student</h3>


## 👩‍🚀 About Me
I am a dedicated and passionate Computer Engineering student, driven by curiosity and a deep interest in the intersection of software development, cybersecurity, and hardware systems. Currently pursuing my Diploma in Computer Engineering from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, I am continuously expanding my knowledge across key domains such as ethical hacking, embedded programming, and AI-integrated system design.

My technical journey began with software-based projects, but it has gradually evolved to encompass the synergy between hardware and software, where I enjoy building solutions that involve both digital logic and intelligent coding. I am especially interested in how embedded technologies and AI models can be combined to create smarter, more efficient systems in real-world applications.

One of my major projects was an AI-powered event management app using React Native and Firebase, integrating an intelligent feedback and attendance tracking system. I also worked on WiseTrack, a NEP 2020-inspired initiative to reduce student dropout rates, using AI models to predict and support at-risk students.

In parallel, I am currently pursuing a certification in Ethical Hacking, with a strong interest in securing digital infrastructures, detecting threats, and ensuring system resilience. My curiosity also extends into digital forensics, where I co-authored a review paper exploring investigative techniques and data security.

With growing experience in hardware-software integration, I aim to work on embedded systems projects where microcontroller logic, sensor data, and AI insights come together to solve meaningful problems.

I thrive in creative and research-driven environments that challenge traditional boundaries and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. My vision is to innovate responsibly at the intersection of intelligence, security, and embedded engineering — contributing to a smarter, safer, and more connected world.
